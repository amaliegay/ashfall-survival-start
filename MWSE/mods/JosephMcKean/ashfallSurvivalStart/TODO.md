Story:

(L) Inquisitor
(M) The subordinate of Inquisitor
(G) Head priest of Masartus
(F) A newly joined monk
(N) A senior monk who dabbled in Necromancy
(A) The Anchroess

A new inquisitor was assigned, who is from a Telvanni family. His family and the family of the head priest of Masartus are rivals, even though G avoids temple and Great Houses politics. M, an Inspector, a subordinate of L came to Masartus, to inform G the new principle established in the recent major meeting, and to inspect if G is practicing unorthodox doctrine. He told G that the Masartus Monastery was out of favor. The temple will cut down on resource delivery as warning.

G is not happy to receive the news.

In the egg mine, the young monk F bet the Inspector to take her away from Masartus. Inspector said kill the Kwama Queen and he'll take her. F killed the queen at night. 

The skeletons raised by N killed the Inspector at night. N lied to G that the Inspector sexually assaulted her and she killed him out of self defense. G decided to shift the blame F but noticed F was not on her bed. They immediately accused her of killing the Inspector when she tried to slip back to her bed. They dragged her to the cellar and locked her inside. 

O is in charged of the egg mine. She found the Kwama Queen dead. She asked M what to do. M said they should take the Ordinators' boat when they came back to pick up L and leave this place. And they did exactly that. 

Guard A landed on the island and left B to guard the ship alone. He asked G where was the Inspector. She said F killed him. F would be brought to Vivec for the crime. When he was ready to leave, he found Guard B's body and the ship gone. Enraged, Guard A thought they were ambushed and attacked G. 

G was killed, and Guard A heavily wounded. F begged Guard A to release her.

Guard A, with the help of F, successfully crafted a raft and left the island together, not to Vivec Temple, but a place faraway from Great House politics. He also left a map behind. 

And there is also one person left on the island. The true anchoress.
