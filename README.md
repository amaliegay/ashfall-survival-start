# Ashfall Survival Start
 
You are stranded on an island called Masartus. Your objective is to craft a raft so you can find your way back to Vvardenfell. 

After you manage to leave the island, drag yourself way back to Seyda Neen and talk to the captain Sellus Gravius to start the Main Quest. 

## General Survival Tips

- To make a campfire, you need a torch. So craft yourself a wood axe and gather resin first.
- If you get stuck somewhere because you can't levitate, consider bushcrafting tables as scaffoldings.
